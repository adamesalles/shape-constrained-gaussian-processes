# Shape-constrained Gaussian Processes

This repository contains the code and resources for a scientific initiation project entitled "Shape-constrained Gaussian Processes" conducted by Eduardo Adame under the supervision of [Professor Luiz Max Carvalho, PhD](https://github.com/maxbiostat).


## Overview

The use of Gaussian processes is a powerful technique for estimating functions which cannot be evaluated across their entire domain, allowing for the quantification of estimation uncertainties, especially when following the Bayesian paradigm. However, when we have prior knowledge about the shape properties of a function, especially its derivatives, it is possible to enhance the quality of our estimates. This project focuses on the development and application of shape-constrained Gaussian processes to improve function estimation.
